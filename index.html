        <p> 
            I am a research engineer with expertise spanning across projects related to
            the energy sector, nuclear, IT, data science and high performance computing
            with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering. Worked in higher education and industry,
            with 5+ years of technical experience, providing consultation and assisting with decision making through various projects, acted as a teaching research assistant and system administrator in the data centre of the University.
            I have developed strong scientific research skills, adapted to challenges to solve problems and specialized in using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and developing numerical methods and models.  I considered myself an experienced Linux user, 
            required to rely on when conducting numerical simulations to solve academic and industry problems and developing 
            software tools and models, in both open-source and commercial packages. 
            <br></br>
            I had the opportunity to work in the scientific Research Computing team of University, expanding my skillset and learning more about High 
            Performance Computing, software engineering practises through managing the servers and data science which intrigued my curiosity. I 've regularly interacted and support researchers with their projects related to running codes on the clusters and
            using scientific machine learning in a variety of fields across the University. I have developed strong coding skills in programming languages via implementing new features and collaborated with fellow software engineers to develop training
            courses to teach researchers on how to effectively use scientific computing.     
            <br></br>
            Currently, I have been working as a thermal hydraulics research engineer in the nuclear sector. My projects involve regularly solving and providing consultation to the customers of the business for thermal hydraulics problems. Some of the work includes the development of
            advanced numerical models for predicting fluid flow and heat transfer in complex systems, the development of software and modelling tools. I have been also leveraging my scientific computing skills and leading activities to provide cloud and IT solutions to the R&D team. I value teamwork and effective collaboration,
            guiding junior engineers and co-supervising PhD students to drive success. Lately, I have been upgrading my skillset and exploring how to combine AI and machine learning with CFD to benefit the customers. These 
            include using neural networks and extending them to account for flow physics, generating synthetic data, developing linear regression to intepret trends in the data, 
            image recognision, developing databases with sqllite to support a client local business. 

            <br></br>
            I am passionate about understanding the complexities of fluid flows and heat transfer within the energy generation sector, renewables and engineering problems in general. 
            I am looking for new challenges and opportuinities to align my interests, 
            to improve my knowledge and exhange my ideas for solving complex problems that benefit the world at large. 
            <br></br>
            I am also enjoying designing and using 3D printers, travelling and exploring new places around the world; having a nice meal, meeting people and a good cup of coffee.
