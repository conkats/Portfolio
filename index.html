        <p> 
            I am a research engineer and data analyst with expertises spanning across 
            projects related to the energy sector, nuclear, IT, data science and high performance computing. 
            I am awared with Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineer fully funded from the University of Manchester and EDF Energy UK, which  I developed strong scientific research skills, adapted to challenges to solve problems 
            and specialized in using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and developing methods/models in open-source software for thermal hydraulics.
            <br></br>
            Worked in the higher education and industry, with 5+ years of experience providing consulation to customers through various projects, acted as a teaching research assistant and system administrator in the data center of the University. 
            I considered myself confident and experienced Linux user, required when using fluid dynamics to solve industry problems and expertise in developming software tools and models, in both open-source and commercial packages, 
            for academia and industry. Published work is within the field of turbulence modelling, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, machine and deep learning.
            <br></br>
            Interested in latest trends of technology, exploring how deep learing and AI can be combined with CFD, the importance of research in fluid dynamics for power plant issues and how datacentres can benefit the wider industry. 
            This motivation is driven from my PhD in developing methods for solving problems in the energy sector and the challenges I had came across with computational resources. 
            After my 7 months post-doc project, I had the opportunity to work in the scientific Research Computing team of University  (~1.6years), I have expanded my skillset and learn
            more about Linux OS benefits, software developing, version control and automatisation of processes through managing and mainting the High Performance Computing servers of the University. I had broadened my understanding of a range of commercial and opensource codes and supported researchers with their projects. 
            I have developed strong coding skills in programming languages not limited but including Python, R, C/C++, bash, html and I considered myself an experinence user of Linux OS in servers and small environmnets.
            I had continously upskill with new technology, implemented new methods and features to codes, automated post-processing workflows 
            and collobared with fellow software engineers to develop training online platforms to teach researchers on how to effectively use software and data driven techniques for their research. 
            <br></br>
            Following this experience, I have been working as a thermal hydraulics research engineer in the nuclear sector (2.5 years), where I have been leading activities and provide both cloud and IT solutions to the R&D team.
            At the same time, I am the task engineer for a range of fluid dynamics projects for solving problems of the clients and even contributing to an external European funded project.
            Some of the work includes the development of advanced models for predicting fluid flow and heat transfer in complex systems, the development of software and modelling tools, 
            data analysis and intepreting the data generated from the simulations. Besides these, I am also guiding junior engineers and co-supervising PhD and MSc projects 
            that we came in up with their project scope. These requires managing and budgeting some of the yearly project, supporting senior colleague and planning the activities of the team.
            <br></br>
            I am passionate about understanding the complexities of fluid flows and heat transfer within the energy generation sector, renewables and engineering problems in general. 
            I am looking for new challenges and opportuinities to align my interests, 
            to improve my knowledge and exhange my ideas for solving complex problems that benefit the world at large. 
            Lately, I have been upgrading my skillset and exploring how to combine AI and machine learning with CFD to benefit the customers. These 
            include using neural networks and extending them to account for flow physics, generating synthetic data, developing linear regression to intepret trends in the data, 
            image recognision, developing databases with sqllite to support a client local business. 
            All these form a key set of tools to support research and engineering activities to support energy and technology businesses.
            
            
            I am also enjoying designing and using 3D printers, travelling and exploring new places around the world; having a nice meal, meeting people and a good cup of coffee.
