                <p> 
Research Engineer and CFD software developer with expertises and projects related to the energy sector, nuclear, data science and high performance computing. Ph.D. focused in Mechanical Engineer from the University of Manchester with strong scientific research skills and specialization in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Thermal Hydraulics.
<br></br>
Worked in the higher education and industry, with 5+ years of experience and expertise in software development, turbulence modelling, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, machine learning/AI for data driven decisions and system administration using Linux OS for High Performance Computing. Experienced in CFD applications including commercial and open-source packages, to name but a few are ANSYS-Fluent, Code_Saturne, OpenFOAM and StarCCM+. I have good coding skills and feel comfortable with many programming languages, including C/C++, Python, Bash which I use to implement methods, new features, pre-processing and post-processing tools and automating workflows. Two years professional experience with High Performance Computing Clusters and continuously using Linux OS. 
<br></br>
\nLooking for new challenges and opportuinities to align my interest with research interest to improve my skills and knowledge and exhange my ideas. I am passionate about about understanding the complexities of fluid flows and heat transfer within the energy generation sector, renewables and engineering problems in general. Lately, I have been upgrading my skillset in data science and machine learning, which form a key set of tools to support research and engineering activities.
