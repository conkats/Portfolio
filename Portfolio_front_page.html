            Research Engineer and data analyst  with expertises and 
            projects related to the energy sector, nuclear, data science and high performance computing. 
            Ph.D. focused in Mechanical Engineer from the University of Manchester with strong scientific research skills and specialization in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), 
            Data Analytics, development of Machine Learning/AI and Thermal Hydraulics models.
            <br></br>
            Worked in the higher education and industry, with 5+ years of experience and expertise in developming software tools for academia and industry in nuclear sector witth some of the work being published in the field of turbulence modelling, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, machine and deep learning.
            system administration using Linux OS for data centers management and maintenance- High Performance Computing. Experienced in CFD applications including commercial and open-source packages.
            <br></br>
            Interested in latest trends of technology, AI and the role of research how datacentres can benefit the wider industry. I had worked in the scientific Research Computing team and managed the datacentre - high performance computing (HPC) cluster at the University of Manchester for a nearly two year period. This broadening my understanding
            about a range of commercial and opensource codes including ANSYS-Fluent, Code_Saturne, OpenFOAM and StarCCM+ via supporting researchers. I have developed strong coding skills in many programming languages such as Python, R, C/C++, bash, html and I considered myself an experinence user of Linux OS in clusters and small environmnets.
            Besides strong time management during this experience, I had continously upskill with new technology, implemented pipelines, methods, new features, pre-processing, post-processing tools, image reckognision, developing database with sqllite, automating workflows and developed platforms when I delivered training for researchers on how to effectively use software in HPC. 
            <br></br>
            Following this experience, I have been working as a thermal hydraulics research engineer in the nuclear sector, where I have been involved a range of projects related to the nuclear energy generation sector, including the development of machine learning models for predicting fluid flow and heat transfer in complex systems,
            the development of software tools for data analysis and visualization, AI and machine learning, managing and budgeting the yearly projects, plan and leading activities, including providing a high-performance computing solutions to 
            the R&D team of the business.
            <br></br>
            I am passionate about understanding the complexities of fluid flows and heat transfer within the energy generation sector, renewables and engineering problems in general; looking for new challenges and opportuinities to align my interests, to improve my skills and knowledge and exhange my ideas for solving complex problems that benefit the world at large. 
            
            Lately, I have been upgrading my skillset in data science, AI and machine learning, which form a key set of tools to support research and engineering activities.
            
            I am a 3D printer enthusiast, enjoy travelling and exploring new places and cultures and a good cup of coffee.
